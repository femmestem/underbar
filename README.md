# Underbar Review

Underbar is a JavaScript exercise to review implementation and usage of the Underscore utility library in JavaScript by rebuilding methods from scratch.

## Exercise Instructions
Each file contains tests and space to implement the method. Write code to implement the method in its respective file, then run the test script from your terminal by calling:

`$ node <fileName>`.

The output will be the test results, `true` for tests passed and `false` for tests failed.
